# Diabetes-Prediction-Model-using-SVM
Dataset

We are considering internal as well as external parameters of patients for analysis.
The proposed methodology is evaluated on Diabetes Dataset namely PIDD (Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset).

Sampling

The data consists of 768 records.
It is split in such a way that training data is 80% and test data is 20%

SVM Model

We are comparing three different kernels for getting most accurate hyperplanes.
The three kernels are “polynomial”, “Radial Basis Function” and “sigmoid”
